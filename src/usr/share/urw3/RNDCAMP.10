At the age of sixteen you left your home not only with some clothes, weapons
and necessary equipment but also with some valuable seeds. When you find a nice
place to settle down you can start growing your own crops. 

(You have some turnip seeds, peas and a shovel with you. That's everything
 needed to try growing your own crops.)
