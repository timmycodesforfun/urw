Start playing at the middle of a wide, unfamiliar wilderness.

At the age of sixteen you've left your home and village.  During  your  childhood  and adolescent
years you have learnt the skills and ways of your people until you decided it was time for you to
go search for a path of your own, whatever it might be.
  Your journey took you far away and the further you went, the more you learned. Even though much
had passed on from your father to you,there would be many things that you must learn on your own.
The lore of your people would help you,  and so would the equipment and supplies  you  had gotten
from your family - but still feelings of insecurity seemed to bother you from time to time.
  One morning you stood still for a long time and listened to the wilderness humming  around you.
Last night you had woken up to the sound of  wolves howling  at  the  moon.  After  that  you had
travelled a long time in the dark. "That wasn't a good idea at all", you thought, standing in the
middle of a totally strange and unknown area.
  Just as you felt over the past few days, you didn't know what you were doing or where  you were
headed. Your path was taking you somewhere - but exactly where was still to become clear to you.

(This scenario doesn't give you any advantages or disadvantages  or  even  a  clear plot to start
 playing. It just simply sends you on your way into the UnReal World.)
