As you were wandering through the wilderness you found a camp.  As  you  explored,  you  saw  that
there was a perfectly usable shelter for rainy nights, some  ready  chopped  firewood  and  a  few
interesting items. This would be a good place for you to spend some time  and  make  journeys  and
hunting trips.

(What brought you here and what kind of your past is like is a matter of your imagination. You are
 at a camp where to ponder about the path to take. You can take items lying around as a  hint,  or
 you can make a fire and throw them into it one by one... as always everything is up to you.)
