Your father lies dead on the ground and the beast who killed him is still present.

For as long as you can remember you had been eager to take part in the hunting trips that the  men
of your home village regularly made. One day you were old enough to do so, and eagerly awaited the
departure of the hunting party.
  You left with your father and a few other hunters and travelled further and further away as  the
game you were tracking didn't seem to follow their usual annual course.
  After a week your father decided to take you back home, and satisfied that you  had  managed  to
get few good kills, you agreed. The rest of the men continued the trip.
  You and your father had been heading back home for two days when you found a  fresh  half  eaten
elk carcass. Unwilling to encounter the beast you changed your course a bit but  didn't  get  very
far as your father, walking before you, stopped. "Wait... I heard something", he said.  You  knelt
down, heart throbbing, and watched as your father silently sneaked ahead and  finally  disappeared
behind a big tree.
  The forest was very silent for a moment, then a cry of your father was mixed with the  sound  of
an attacking beast. You jumped to your feet and started to run towards the noise...
  You found your father lying on the ground and bleeding badly. "Son... you must go... it's a...",
your father whispered - then he was gone.

(Selecting this scenario gives you immediate fighting experience.  If you manage to kill the beast
 or even escape from it you are on your own in the middle of the wide, unfamiliar environment. The
 equipment of your late father may become very useful to you if you manage to pick them up  -  and
 that way even though you are alone in the world now, your family will be with you.)
