Having been slave to Njerpezit for years you finally take a step to escape from your captors.

You have few memories of your parents, your home and your life as a free,  happy  youngster.  Then
there are the memories of a sudden attack... terror and  burning  houses...  memories  of  Njerpez
warriors dragging you away with a few crying wives and other young men, barely alive,  through the
forest. You were taken far away and from there on you could neither hear nor see  people  of  your
own.
  You grew up as a slave. On your rare spare time you secretly  took  care  of  ways,  skills  and
language of your own. Someday, you swore, you would escape and return home.
  A change came upon you as the Njerpez village you were  brought  to  started  to  talk  about  a
looting expedition at an area that had lived at peace for years: your late home-area. Few  slaves,
including you, were also taken to take part in the expedition.
  You travelled first with a large party but as soon as you were no longer  on  Njerpez  territory
you separated into smaller groups.Once, as your party had encamped, you were sent nearby to gather
some firewood with a young guard. At that point you decided to take action.
  You attacked the young Njerpez bare-handed, managed to knock him down, and quickly  grabbed  his
weapon from him and stabbed him dead. You started to run away aimlessly  through  the  forest  but
soon ended up in the middle of another Njerpez camp!
  Was your escape going to end like this? No - you were desperate and if you were  ever  going  to
get free it would be now...

(You are lightly dressed,  carrying only few weapons.  If you manage to escape,  surviving  in the
 wilderness like this, without supplies, may get very hard. On  the  other hand  fighting  against
 superior enemy may be more foolish - even though they are carrying equipment you too could use.)
