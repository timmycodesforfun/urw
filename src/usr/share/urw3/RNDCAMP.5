HURT, HELPLESS, AND AFRAID
Wounded and left for dead, you struggle to survive in the wilderness.

One cold night, as you were wandering through the wilderness, you were surrounded by a group 
of Njerpezit. You were hopelessly outnumbered, but you fought anyway. Remarkably, you slew two 
of the men as their blades pierced your flesh. However, there were too many, and you simply
could not defeat them all. You stabbed yet another of the bandits with your knife, but as you 
withdrew your knife from his flesh, you were struck from behind, and fell unconscious. Hours 
passed. When you finally regained your consciousness, you found yourself alone; apparently, 
the Njerpezit had left you for dead. They had stripped you of your possessions, save for a 
couple pieces of clothing, and you discovered that your injuries prevented you from performing 
most tasks. Shivering in the cold, you began to crawl onward, your hand brushing your knife, 
which had somehow been lost in the struggle.

(This is a difficult scenario, as you have suffered rather severe injuries, making you 
 incapable of walking. You also lack anything but your knife and a few pieces of clothing. 
 It is very possible to die from the injuries you have suffered. This scenario is recommended 
 for advanced players only!)
